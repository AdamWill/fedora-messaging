Documentation for consumers indicated any callable object was acceptable to use
as a callback as long as it accepted a single positional argument (the
message). However, the implementation required that the callable be a function
or a class, which it then instantiated. This has been fixed and you may now use
any callable object, such as a method or an instance of a class that implements
``__call__``
